(thuds)

4
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:29,614
I have to say
I was impressed.

5
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,867
You had taken a risk.

6
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,328
Getting your hands dirty.

7
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:41,960
You know, we were
gonna have those biters

8
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:45,046
for our little
Michonne and--

9
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:50,009
Milton: You were gonna use them
on whoever showed up.

10
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,720
That's right.

11
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,723
Hey,

12
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,267
Because we didn't
have them,

13
00:00:57,434 --> 00:01:00,520
you burned them up,

14
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,064
eight of my men died.

15
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,991
Now, you knew
those men. Huh?

16
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:17,787
They kept you safe,
kept you fed.

17
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,458
As long as I looked
the other way.

18
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,460
Yeah.

19
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,629
Well, it can't be
like that anymore.

20
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,509
Time for you to graduate.

21
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,099
Hey.

22
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,981
I'm gonna tell you
the secret.

23
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,444
There's a threat,
you end it.

24
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,655
And you don't feel ashamed
about enjoying it.

25
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:57,702
You smell the gunpowder
and you see the blood--

26
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,829
you know what that means?

27
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,834
It means you're alive.

28
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:09,839
You've won.

29
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,343
You take the heads
so that you don't ever forget.

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,597
You kill or you die.

31
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:26,523
What would
your daughter think

32
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,399
about what you are?

33
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,614
She'd be afraid of me.

34
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,533
But if I had been
like this from the start,

35
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,868
she'd be alive today.

36
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:53,466
Did you kill Andrea?

37
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,635
( Andrea gasping )

38
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,512
Milton.

39
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,473
Governor:
See? She's still alive.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,059
I'm gonna need her
for something.

41
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,978
Andrea: I heard you
in the other room.

42
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,981
You don't have to lose
any more of your men.

43
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,649
Just stop this.

44
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,528
Your friends
at the prison--

45
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,406
I'm gonna kill them all.

46
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:18,908
People are gonna help me.

47
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,745
I had to stretch the truth
a little bit, but just a little.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,416
Now they're foaming
at the mouth.

49
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,545
You, get those tools.

50
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,463
I'm not gonna
need them anymore.

51
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,132
Go on.

52
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,268
Careful.
Pick that up.

53
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,403
Come on! Step to.
Let's go.

54
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,203
Hold up.

55
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,957
I'll take that.

56
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,626
Put 'em down.

57
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,299
( Panting )

58
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,846
You're gonna
kill her now.

59
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,101
You're gonna show me
that you've learned something.

60
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,106
Milton...

61
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,693
there is no way
you are leaving this room

62
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,320
without doing it.

63
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:40,573
So don't make it hard.
Just--

64
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,785
just do it.

65
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,499
That's it.

I told you
you were gonna do it.

71
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,119
And now you're gonna die.

72
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,414
And you're gonna turn.

73
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,917
And you're gonna tear
the flesh from her bones.

74
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,011
In this life now,

75
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,596
you kill or you die.

76
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,020
Or you die and you kill.

Carl.

79
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,908
I've never seen him
this mad.

80
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:14,370
Even with Lori.
He just shut down.

81
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,958
He's still a kid.

82
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,419
It's easy to forget.

83
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,943
You know, Merle never did
nothing like that his whole life.

84
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,654
He gave us a chance.

85
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,592
We're ready.

86
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,391
The deal the Governor
offered about me--

87
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,936
you had to think
about it.

88
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,022
You had to.
I get it.

89
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,360
Yeah.

90
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,446
I'm sorry.
I came real close.

91
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,490
But you didn't.

92
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,290
I never thanked you.

93
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,960
For what?

94
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,672
For getting me
out there that day,

95
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,590
taking me in.

96
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:55,596
Well, if you didn't have
that baby formula,

97
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,640
I wouldn't have.

98
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,226
You could have
just taken the formula.

99
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,770
Well...

100
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,189
must have been
something else, then.

101
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:11,821
You know, it was Carl
who made the call.

102
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,615
He said you belonged here.

103
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,118
You're one of us.

104
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:29,422
Remember, they killed
eight men back there.

105
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,340
- ( Guns clicking)
- Five here last time.

106
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,884
They're no different
from the biters.

107
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,554
They're not gonna stop
until they kill us all,

108
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,557
taken everything
we've worked so hard for.

109
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,018
We're gonna end this
once and for all.

110
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,686
Governor.

111
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,023
This ain't easy to say.

112
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,192
You're gonna have
to count us out.

113
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,528
Sasha:
This isn't our fight.

114
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,488
Tyreese: We'll fight
against the biters,

115
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,657
not other people.

116
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,160
Now we'll stay here
and defend the children.

117
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,371
When you return,
if you want us gone,

118
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,749
no hard feelings.

119
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,563

Let's split up.
You take a group that way.

131
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,572
You, bring a group,
follow me.

132
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,994
( Door creaking )

133
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,338
Go.

00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:12,348
- Andrea: Milton?
- When the tools dropped,

135
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,726
I-I left some pliers

136
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,979
on the floor behind you.

137
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,525
If you can drag--
( pants )

138
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,696
if you can drag your right foot back,
you-- you can get them.

139
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,462
That-- that's it.

140
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:47,216
- Oh, God.
- Almost.

141
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,551
I'm gonna get us both
out of here.

142
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,887
And you're gonna be okay.

143
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,556
Now when--
when you get free,

144
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:58,227
you are going to find
something very sharp...

145
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,190
and you are going
to stab me in the head.

146
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,113
That is what
you are going to do.

147
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,992
Keep trying-

148
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,621
Come on.

149
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,922
( Door squeaks )

150
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,977
Hey.

151
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,062
Over there.

152
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,194
- ( Distant clang )
- What was that?

153
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,992
- ( Clatters )
- Shh.

00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,580

155
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,918
This way.

156
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,853
We took out a few biters
on the south wall.

157
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,273
Other than that,
everything's quiet.

158
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,192
I'll get the next one.

159
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,738
What do you think happens
when they return?

160
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,949
We might have to slip out.
Andrea made it out.

161
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,453
If she's at the prison,
it didn't do her any good.

162
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,371
I'll be right back.

163
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,290
- It's my turn.
- Stay put.

164
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,626
I got it.

165
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,840
( Door closes )

166
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,343
I got it. I got it.

167
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,765
Milton?

168
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:24,248
( Groans, gasps )

169
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,000

170
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,710
Milton.

171
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,380
Why did you stay...

172
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,344
after you found out
your friends were out there?

173
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,140
I wanted to save everyone.

174
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,563
Even the Governor
for a while.

175
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,025
I had a chance to kill him.

176
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,027
What stopped you?

177
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,488
You know,
this was before.

178
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:00,284
He was asleep.
I had a knife.

179
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,413
But I tried to stop it all
another way...

180
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,086
because I didn't want
anyone to die.

181
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,102
I'm still here.

182
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:32,274
I'm still alive.

183
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,027
Yeah.

184
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,613
You are.

185
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,784
You need to hurry.

186
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,791
Right.

187
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,836
Okay.

188
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,728
- ( Explosion )
- ( all shouting )

189
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,772
( alarm blaring )

190
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,150
- Hold your ground!
- ( shouting continues )

191
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,486
Hold your ground!

192
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,948
( Snarling )

193
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,991
(gunfire)

194
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,579
( people screaming )

195
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,963
Get the hell out of here!

196
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,676
( Distant gunfire )

197
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,098
I should be there.

198
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,557
Go.

199
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,519
- ( Coughing )
- ( gunfire)

200
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,524
- Move!
- Go. Go, go, go.

201
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,612
Go.

202
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,572
Move! Move!

203
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,081
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

204
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,582
- Allen: It's not working.
- Go, man!

205
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,376
Shit.
It's jammed!

206
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:17,004
- Return--
- ( gunfire )

207
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,923
Hey!

208
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,259
They're not going anywhere.
Come on.

209
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:27,556
( Bullets ricocheting )

210
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,315
We did it?

211
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,942
We did it.

212
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,444
Come on down.

213
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't shoot.

214
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,461
Drop the weapon, son.

215
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,463
Sure.

216
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,090
Here, take it.

217
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,473
-(gunshot)
-(thuds)

218
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,445
( all panting )

219
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,950
We did it.
We drove them out.

220
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,494
We should go after them.

221
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,454
- We should finish it.
- Maggie: It is finished.

222
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,955
Didn't you see them
hightail it out of here?

223
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,791
- Michonne: They could regroup.
- We can't take the chance.

224
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,334
- He's not gonna stop.
- They're right.

225
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,627
We can't keep
living like this.

226
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:39,836
So we take the fight
back to Woodbury.

227
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,379
We barely made it back
last time.

228
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,964
He don't care.

229
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,050
Yeah.

230
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,429
Let's check on the others.

231
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,182
( Door closes )

232
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,944
( Judith coos )

233
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,113
Hey.

234
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,122
- Hey.
- Dad, I'm coming to Woodbury.

235
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,791
- Carl.
- Dad, I did do my job out there.

236
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,668
Just like all of you.

237
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,336
Took out one
of the Governor's soldiers.

238
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,131
Hershel:
One of his soldiers?

239
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,842
A kid running away?
He stumbled across us.

240
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,677
No, he drew on us.

241
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,513
I'm sorry you had
to do that.

242
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,807
It's what I was there for.

243
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,976
I'm going with you.

244
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,897
( Door opens )

245
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,984
That kid was scared.

246
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,361
He was handing
his gun over.

247
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,698
He said he drew.

248
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,703
Carl said it was
in defense.

249
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,164
I was there.
He didn't have to shoot.

250
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,665
He had every reason
not to--

251
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,125
Maybe it looked like
that to you, Hershel--

252
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,710
Rick!

253
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,716
I'm telling you

254
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,468
he gunned that kid down.

255
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,895
- ( Tires squeal )
-( honking horn )

256
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,855
Move over!

257
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,858
Hey!
I want this truck over.

258
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,027
Go.
Pull in front of them.

259
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,698
( Tires squeal )

260
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:35,744
What the hell
are you doing?

261
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,829
- We need to dig in.
- Paul: It's not worth it.

262
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,873
- That was a slaughter.
- You bunch of pussies.

263
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,541
I told you we should have
handled this shit ourselves.

264
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,251
We're done fighting
for a hole with a half dozen

265
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:45,086
psychopaths living in it.
They can keep it.

266
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,255
Allen: You've seen what
they've done-- attacked us.

267
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,049
They killed my boy.
We're going back.

268
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,260
We are not soldiers.
Want us to kill biters, of course.

269
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,929
- But this is crazy.
- Allen: Go home, then.

270
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,305
You think you're
gonna be safe?

271
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,556
Paul: I'm going back
to Woodbury.

272
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,642
We're not here
to settle a grudge.

273
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,894
( Screaming )

274
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,106
(gunfire)

275
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,137
( bird cawing )

276
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,032
( gasping quietly )

277
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,704
(gunshot)

278
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:13,258
( bird cawing )

279
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,473
( exhales )

280
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,296
( taps )

281
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,057
( pliers scraping )

282
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,686
Come on.

283
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,188
Okay.

284
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,899
Okay.

285
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,944
Okay.
All right.

286
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:22,243
You're still here.

287
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,996
You're still alive.

288
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,748
All right.

289
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,885
Shit!

290
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,823
All right.

291
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,372
- All right. Okay.
- ( soft clang )

292
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,826
Michonne.

293
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,176
Hershel told me
about the boy you shot.

294
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,095
He had a gun.

295
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,264
Hmm.

296
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,477
Was he handing it over?

297
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,940
- He had just attacked us.
- Yeah.

298
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,234
Yes, he had.

299
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,531
Was he handing it over?

300
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,038
I couldn't take the chance.

301
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,915
I didn't kill the walker
that killed Dale.

302
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,042
- Look what happened.
- Son, that is not the same thing.

303
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,503
You didn't kill Andrew

304
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,130
and he came back
and killed Mom.

305
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,384
You were in a room
with the Governor

306
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,803
and you let him go.

307
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,389
And then he killed Merle.

308
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,059
I did what I had to do.

309
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:56,189
Now go.

310
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,609
So he doesn't kill
any more of us.

311
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,486
( Metal clinks)

312
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,714
Rick, we're staying.

313
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,466
We don't know
where the Governor is.

314
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,426
If he comes back,
we'll hold him off.

315
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,429
Just the three of us?

316
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,099
All right.

317
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,101
I appreciate you staying.

318
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,811
Sure.

319
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,955
Come on, come on.

320
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,149
( Crunching )

321
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,651
( snarling )

322
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,635
( bangs )

323
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,762
( hammer clicks )

324
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,164
( snarling )

325
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,920
Come on.
Come on.

326
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,853
Okay, Okay-

327
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,858
Oh! Come on!

328
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:54,200
( Andrea screaming )

329
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,578
( Milton snarling )

330
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:01,207
(thudding )

331
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,711
( metal squeaking )

332
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,724
(gunshot)

333
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,026
Karen:
Tyreese!

334
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:32,572
- It's me! Don't--
- Get down!

335
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,073
Tyreese:
Karen!

336
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,700
Karen, are you okay?

337
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,870
- I'm fine!
- Where's the Governor?

338
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,913
He fired on everyone.

339
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,957
He killed them all.

340
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,551
- Tyreese: Why are you with them?
- They saved me.

341
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,098
We're coming out!

342
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,017
No.

343
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,979
We're coming out.

344
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:27,418
Tyreese:
What are you doing here?

345
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,171
We were coming
to finish this

346
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:33,925
until we saw
what the Governor did.

347
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:38,429
Tyreese:
He-- he killed them?

348
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,682
Yeah.

349
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,018
Karen told us
Andrea hopped the wall

350
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,520
going for the prison.

351
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,563
She never made it.

352
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,442
She might be here.

353
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,361
Rick: This is where he had
Glenn and Maggie.

354
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:54,862
Tyreese: The Governor
held people here?

355
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,864
Daryl: He did more
than hold them.

356
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,970
Will you open it?

357
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,184
One, two...

358
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,898
Andrea!

359
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,408
I tried to stop them.

360
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,618
You're burning up.

361
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:56,090
Judith, Carl,

362
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,009
the rest of them...

363
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,720
Us.

364
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,514
The rest of us.

365
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,311
Are they alive?

366
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:17,486
Yeah, they're alive.

367
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,914
It's good you found them.

368
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,421
No one can
make it alone now.

369
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:38,633
They never could.

370
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:46,349
I just didn't want
anyone to die.

371
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,148
- I can do it myself.
- No.

372
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,984
I have to.

373
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,655
While I still can.

374
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,040
Please?

375
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,132
I know how
the safety works.

376
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,486
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

377
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,427
I tried.

378
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,180
Yeah.

379
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,767
You did.

380
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,770
You did.

381
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,686
(gunshot)

382
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:07,133
No, it's okay.

383
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,681
What is this?

384
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,518
They're gonna join us.

385
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,595
