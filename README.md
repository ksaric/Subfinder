Subfinder
=========

A project designed to quickly find all the subtitles of a movie, series, or a recursive folder containing them.

Requires Java 7.

Currently using SubsMax subtitles. Switch to http://www.api.subtitleseeker.com:82/?
Using Guice Multibindings for a flexibile architecture(plugins for other sub providers).

Ideas:

Using ExecutorService, and than testing Actors and maybe STM(Akka)?
"Inspecting Multibindings or MapBindings" for an even more flexibile plugin solution?
