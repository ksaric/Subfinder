Subfinder
=========

A project designed to quickly find all the subtitles of a movie, series, or a recursive folder containing them.

Requires Java 7.

Using SubsMax subtitles.

Ideas:

Using ExecutorService, and than testing Actors and maybe STM(Akka)?
Also, use advanced matching system - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:String_matching_algorithms
